Abstract-Introduction:

I have built games in the Python language named 2048.
2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048

Design:

1. I have created a UI for Python 2048 to run
2. On top of that, you can see the score
3. And below that, I have a 4×4 grid where tiles will automatically generate 
4. If you keep playing the game then the end screen will appear to you that you have Win/Lose.

Application:

The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board.

2048 is played on a plain 4×4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.
Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.

Working:

I have used Tkinter
For this project
Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit and is Python's de facto standard GUI.

•  Imported Tkinter as tk
•  Imported colors as c

•  Class game (tk. Frame):
•  Making score header
•  Creating a matrix of zeros
•  Filling 2 random cells with 2s
•  Matrix manipulate functions
•  Adding a new 2 or 4 tile randomly to an empty cell
•  Update the GUI to match the matrix
•  Arrow-press function 
•  Checking if any moves are available 
•  Checking if the game is over (Win/Lose)

Future scope/vision:
I am planning to create a website for it or an application in future 

Conclusion:

1. The game runs nicely without any problem.
2. I had joy in developing this program.
3. And learn how to use modern tools and methods.
